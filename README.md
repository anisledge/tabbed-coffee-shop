# tabbed-coffee-shop
A single-page JavaScript/jQuery restaurant website, based on the [OdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com/home) project ['Manipulating the DOM with jQuery'](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery).
The goal of the project was to create a restaurant-themed webpage, and use jQuery to generate and toggle between 
the home, contact, and menu views.
